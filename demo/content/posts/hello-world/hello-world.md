## Quick Markdown Test

This is a math equation from [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11628)

$$
\min _{x} \frac{1}{n}\left\|\boldsymbol{T}^{T} \boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}\right\|_{2}^{2} \text { s.t. } \boldsymbol{x}^{T} \mathbf{1}=1, \text { and } \boldsymbol{x} \succeq \mathbf{0}
$$


This is some python code that can be useful

```python
for i in range(10):
  print(i)
```

Some good quote

> 1 + 1 = 2
