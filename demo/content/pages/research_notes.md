This is a collection of notes/monograph, in which, each contains one main subfield in machine learning.
We will surveying papers related to certain topics, and expand it into one long story start to end.
This is made to reduce frictions for people who wanted to jump right into these subfields.

  * Probabilistic Reinforcement Learning
  * Counterfactual Regret Minimization
  * Multi-Task and Life-Long reinforcement learning
  * Population Based Training.
