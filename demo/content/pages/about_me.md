## Who Am I ?

I am Phu Sakulwongtana. My name, in Thai, is pronounced as *pooh*, although many people avoid calling me this (for some obvious reason), and call me *fu* instead, which I don't mind. Right now, I am in my last year (Third Year) doing Bsc. Computer Science at University College London.

## What is this ?

I created this website mainly to store what I know for future usages. This includes: Some UCL Class Notes (mainly for third year, since they are more interesting), Course Notes (MOOC/Youtube/Textbook), Research survey (mainly in machine learning), Essay on some topics, and occasionally talked about software development (mostly deep learning focused). These are the topics that I would like to publish in this websites:

My goal is to create a scalable, robust decision making system that could be deployed in *real world*. Right now, I am focusing on learning the tools needed to achieve this goal -- optimization, game theory, statistics, and optimal control. I have been working on multi-agent reinforcement learning for a year now, and my thesis (WIP) is based on this sub-field.
